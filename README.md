## About darkdig
darkdig is a simple script written in Python3.11 in which it allows users to enter a search term (query) in the command line and darkdig will pull all the deep web onion sites relating to that query. Added to by Nathan Jones nathan.jones@arcadeusops.com. Based on DarkDump by Josh Schiavone, additions include output to file (XML), then conversion to HTML/PDF, and email.
